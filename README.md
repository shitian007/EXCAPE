A project that draws inspiration from “Escape Room” games and features online programming puzzles. Utilizes CS1101S Source as the programming language to ensure that users do not make use of functionality that make puzzles trivial. Geared mainly towards users starting out with Computer Science. 

-- Currently in progress--

Proposal: 

Basic Functionality
-	User registration that includes programming problems which provide a gauge in proficiency of the user.

-	Leveling up feature (includes leaderboard) that unlocks further functionality within the Source language to allows user to solve more complex puzzles.

-	Paths upon levelling up to get users up to speed of new Source language functionalities.

-	Party function that encourages players of similar proficiency but have different skillsets (OOP V.S. Procedural programming) to team up to solve escape room puzzles.

-	Tutorials that allow users to learn more about the theory side of programming

Features
Within each escape-room mission:
-	Multiple rooms that offer different forms of puzzles
-	Certain functionalities that are unlocked upon completing certain puzzles to lend a sense of continuity to missions
-	Possible bonus questions / Solving a puzzle without using certain functionalities that add to the overall score of the player
-	Skip function that deducts the score of that playthrough but allows players to complete the mission without solving all the puzzles
User-content creation 
-	Overarching story/Blueprint for new missions
-	Individual puzzles that can be added as bonus components of escape rooms 
-	Collaborative projects that allow users to work together on new escape rooms 
-	Verifiable working solution using specified version of Source before publication
-	Leaderboard for users that have created popular missions
